# Trafic-Sim
U-SimTrafic is a open source trafic simulator built in Unity.
As other simulators,U-SimTrafic integrate driving model algorithms enabling vehicles to move autonomously.
It enables researchers and developer to test multiples scenarios related to trafic road using Reinforcement Learning and other Machine Learning technics. 
A paper was submitted about the the simulator in a conference about Internet of Thing.
